1- please download the whole of the project then copy it to src folder.

3- you can find the output on this path:..\coding-challenge-master\tweet_output\output.txt

5- you can open the project and build and if you want change the input and output path on TextExtraction.cs class



Notification:

1- I just tries to provide exactly the same tree for files and resources. 

2- My program tries to pick up tweets.txt from tweet_input folder and will put the output.txt on tweet_output.

3- sunning the run_tests causes some problem to me!

4- easily just download my project and just run the exe file on run folder. Do not forgot to put your files on input path.

5- if you want to see my project on Visual Studio and run it, you need NewtonSoft.Json which is a dll file and you can easily download it by NuGet.

6- One Sample of the output already is available on output.txt
